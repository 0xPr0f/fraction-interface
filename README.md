# Fraction Protocol
Fraction is a protocol that allow users to earn on a particular asset, the ability to wrap an asset (usually a stablecoin) to an ERC1155 and earn yield in form of superfluid streams of a custom token.
We also offer the ability to mint a soulbound nft that bound users to their assets and earn them more interests in the streams

### context:   
Fraction is a protocol that allow users to earn on a particular asset, the ability to wrap an asset (usually a stablecoin) to an ERC1155 and earn yield in form of superfluid streams of a custom token. We also offer the ability to mint a soulbound nft that bound users to their assets and we use unstoppable domain to login with their domain names as proof of humanity to earn them more interests in the reward streams of our ERC20 token. Although not mentioned in the video, the contracts were deployed and the inferface is only currently available on polygon mumbai chain and we are looking forward to a migration to mainnet.       

we integrate different protocols :
- covalent : covalent is used to make our analytics dashboard (where we determine the tokensholders, balance of users e.t.c)         
- unstoppable domain : we offer unstoppable domain login as the best login choice due to the proof of humanity it does by loging in with your domain name, it eliminates of bots (non human), logging in with your domain provides you with extra rewards when it comes to earnings     
- superfluid : superfluid is the protocol behind the streaming of rewards, we eliminate the defacto claim button on most web3 dapps by sending the rewards directly to the users as they are staking or wrapping their stablecoins (or other supported assets)       
- polygon : the protocol currently sits on polygon testnet (all contracts are deployed on polygon tesnet)
